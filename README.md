# ML Algorithms from Scratch ðŸ§ 

This repository contains implementations of basic ML algorithms coded using only NumPy â€” no sklearn magic!

## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression (ordinary least square, gradient descent)

## Purpose
To understand the math and logic behind core ML models.

## Tools
- Python 3
- NumPy
