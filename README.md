# 🧠 ML Algorithms from Scratch (with Scikit-learn Comparison)

This repository contains implementations of foundational Machine Learning algorithms built **from scratch using NumPy** — alongside **scikit-learn versions** for direct comparison.
The goal is to deeply understand the **math, logic, and behavior** behind real-world ML models.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 Linear Regression

* Ordinary Least Squares (Single & Multiple Features)
* Gradient Descent (manual implementation)
* Scikit-learn comparison (`LinearRegression`)

### 🔹 Logistic Regression

* Gradient Descent (manual implementation)

## 🎯 Purpose

To explore how machine learning algorithms work *under the hood* by:

* Deriving and coding them from first principles
* Comparing results, performance, and accuracy with sklearn
* Visualizing training progress and regression lines

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Pandas**
* **Scikit-learn** (for validation & comparison)
